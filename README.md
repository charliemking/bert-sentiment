# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

I fine-tuned `bert-base-uncased` on the IMDb movie reviews dataset using HuggingFace Transformers. My goal was to classify movie reviews as positive or negative with high accuracy. The model achieved 91% test accuracy. I evaluated it using F1 scores and confusion matrices, and gained valuable experience training large models on GPUs.
